Dasymetric Mapping for Detailed Population Distribution in Salzburg City

This project applies dasymetric mapping to redistribute Salzburg’s district-level population data into a high-resolution, building-level population map. Using a limiting variable method and combining building footprints, DSM–DEM-derived heights, and volume-based weighting, the study produces an accurate representation of where people actually live within the city.
